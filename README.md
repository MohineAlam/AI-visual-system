# AI-visual-system
## This repository contains the code for the AI visual system I put together

In this project I used the following 
hardware:
- Lumenera LU200c industrial camera (including USB-B to USB-A cable and charger)
- Raspberry Pi 4 b+ (including micro SD and charger)

And software:
- Software Developer Kit v6.9.0 from Lucam Teledyne (link for windows: https://www.teledynevisionsolutions.com/en-gb/support/support-center/software-firmware-downloads/lumenera/lucam-software-and-software-development-kit/)
- py-lucam (wrapper library)
- opencv-python (image/video processing includnig computer vision library)
- numpy (powers image processing with maths within arrarys e.g. ([1,2,3],[4,5,6]))
- pytorch (deep learning framework and computer vision libraries - image classification and object detection)
